# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This weather dashboard was created as a traveler. I want to see the weather outlok for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly. I wanted to be able to search a city I wanted to visit, and get the current and future conditions for that specific city. While creatig this project, I learned how to add the cities to the user's search history so they could easily click the previously searched city. I learned how to use an API to extract data. One thing that I would like to improve in the future is how the icons are displayed. They appear as night time icons instead of for the day. I would also like to manipulate the API URL in order to automatically convert metric to customary units.
